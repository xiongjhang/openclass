# CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning: Deep Learning for Computer Vision - Winter 2025

> Official Website: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/

**Short Description**\
Natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, politics, etc. In the 2010s, deep learning (or neural network) approaches obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that did not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In the 2020s amazing further progress was made through the scaling of Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to both the basics of Deep Learning for NLP and the latest cutting-edge research on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models, using the Pytorch framework.
